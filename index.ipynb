    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was born after many scientific paper reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design goals are:\n",
    " - to share how one understands a paper\n",
    " - to quickly prototype the methods described in the paper at hand using for example Python or a programming language supported by Jupyter\n",
    " - to test new hypothesis and write new papers\n",
    " - to applying Machine Learning tools on the generated notebooks. \n",
    " - to contibute to research reproducibility as in [1].\n",
    " \n",
    "Naturaly, Jupyter was chosen to serve as the framework for scientific paper reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to install the necessary tools for using Jupyter in this context. It also provides an installation procedure using Docker\n",
    "- How to use the existing notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The following  installation procedure are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Anaconda\n",
    "2.  pip and virtualenv\n",
    "3.  Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the appropriate installation method depends on the specific needs.\n",
    "Note that Mininet and RabbitMQ are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, these methods have been tested only on GNU/Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anantomy of a Scientific paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Many schemes (see [2]-[5]) have been proposed for how to oraganize a paper or how to read it (fast).\n",
    "Definitly, one needs a method to be able to keep up with the pace of publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the following organization is chosen for a paper:\n",
    " - the title: the original paper's title\n",
    " - abstract: short summary of the paper\n",
    " - the problem studied\n",
    " - the solution proposed\n",
    " - the experimentations\n",
    " - observations of the reader\n",
    " - a way of translating new English words in the language of the reader\n",
    "\n",
    "All the sections lead to the creation of a Jupyter notebook consider as a template.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation of the tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "See: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation, type the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -i -t -p 8888:8888 -v reviews:/opt/reviews  \\\n",
    "icollaboration /bin/bash -c \"/opt/conda/bin/conda install jupyter -y &&\\\n",
    "/opt/conda/bin/conda create -n ipykernel_py2 python=2 ipykernel &&\\\n",
    "/opt/conda/bin/jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=/opt/reviews --ip='*' \\\n",
    "--port=8888 --no-browser \"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is to use the Python requirements file provided.\n",
    "It contains Jupyter and other libraries like numpy and scipy.\n",
    "Assuming that Python 3 is the installed Python version, the installation is done by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd install/python\n",
    "$ ./install.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation, Jupyter can be launched by typing in the install/python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ source icollaboration/bin/activate\n",
    "$ cd ../../reviews\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Dockerfile\n",
    "This method requires, to have Docker installed. Optionally, docker-compose can be used.\n",
    "It will only used the anaconda distribution in a Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation is done by typing in the docker folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd docker/anaconda\n",
    "$./build.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will install the anaconda3 docker image. Depending on the local privileges, it might be necessary to become root.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the image is built, simply :\n",
    "- Edit the script to insert the path to the reviews directory\n",
    "- and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd docker/anaconda\n",
    "$ ./run.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach with Docker, is the use of docker-compose. A compose file is already provided with services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anadonda\n",
    "- RabbitMQ\n",
    "- Mininet\n",
    "\n",
    "For installing the tools using this method, simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ docker-compose up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time, all the necessary tools will be installed. Subsequent typing will launch the services and expose the port.\n",
    "For example, connection is possible on http://localhost:8888\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interactive Collaboration using this approach\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation, you can connect to http://localhost:8888\n",
    "\n",
    "Which shows the root tree:\n",
    " - data : the datasets used in the original papers\n",
    " - install: folder containing installation methods\n",
    " - resources: images, etc.\n",
    " - reviews: containing the notebooks organised form the research field.\n",
    " - Template.ipynb: the Template used to create all the notebooks\n",
    " - README.md: this readme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the existing notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The existing notebooks were made on papers related to privacy, security and networking in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS).\n",
    "These notebooks can be accessed by navigating through the review directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating new notebooks from the Template\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new papers reviews:\n",
    "1. Open Template.ipynb in Jupyter\n",
    "2. Click on File -> Make a Copy\n",
    "3. Save and mane the copy\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly created notebook can then be used to review the paper at hand.\n",
    "Python programming language is used to try to reproduce the results on a given paper. \n",
    "However, many languages can be used provided the kernel is supported in Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This approach was designed for quick prototyping and exchange between researchers.\n",
    "It requires to take the time to carefully review important papers and share their essence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to improve and share with us your work.\n",
