    "  - How can the data be released with a 'scientific guarrantees' that individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain particularly usefull ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The paper presents k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment\n",

    "## The problem studied\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exponential growth of the number and variety of data collections\n",
    "- Data holders, operating autonomously and with limited knownledge, are left with the difficulty of releasing information that does not compromise the  privacy, confidentiality and national interests\n",
    "- The survival of the database itself depends on the data holder's ability to produce anonymous data because not relasing such information at all may dimish the need for the data, while on the other hand, failing to provide propoer protection within a relase may create circumtances that harm the public or others\n",
    "- A common practice is for organizations to realse and receive person-specific data with all explicit identifiers, such as name, address and telephone number removed on the assumption that anonymity is maintained because the resulting data look anonymous. \n",
    "- The remaining data can be use to re-identify individuals by linking or matching the data to other data or by looking at unique characteristics found in the realesead data\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many individuals within a geographycally situated population had combinations of demographic values that occured infrequently ?\n",
    "- Combinations of few characteristics often combine in polpulation to uniquely or nearly uniquely identify some individuals:\n",
    "   - 87% of the U.S population reported characteristics that uniquely made them unique based only on 5 digit ZIP, gender, date of birth. \n",
    "   - Data released containing such information about these individuals should not be considered anonymous\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exemple of re-identification\n",
    "- Linking the medical data and voter list led to the identification of William Weld governor of Massachusetts. "
