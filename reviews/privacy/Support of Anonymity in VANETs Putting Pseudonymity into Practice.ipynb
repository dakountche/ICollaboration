    "### Architecture of VANET \n",
    "\n",
    "As described on the Figure \n",
    "![VANET achitecture](vanet.png \"The VANET architecture considered in the paper\")\n",
    "\n",
    "-  In-vehicle sub-network contains:\n",
    "    - On Board Unit (OBU)\n",
    "    - Application Units (AU or APUs): user devices attached to the OBU\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ad Hoc domain:\n",
    "    -  OBU and stationary Road Side Units\n",
    "    -  OBU and RSU can communicate directly or use multi-hop communication\n",
    "    -  Support position based routing (PBR) for efficient and scalable communication:       \n",
    "        - unicast: greedy forwarding\n",
    "        - geocast: efficient packet broadcasting in a geographical area \n",
    "\n",
    "- Infrastructure domain:\n",
    "    - provides connectivity to Internet (through the RSU when supported)\n",
    "\n",
    "- PBR supports:\n",
    "     - beaconing (periodically advertising identifier, position to direct neighbor nodes)\n",
    "     - location service:  destination node is searched for its current location\n",
    " \n",
    "- OBU:\n",
    "    - maintains a soft-state _Location Table_ (LT) with at least the parameters of the correspondant nodes (Neighbors and non-neighbors):\n",
    "         - identifier\n",
    "         - position\n",

    "         \n",

    "\n",
    "- LT is used for routing unicast packets and for choosing the next hop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every node has a unique and static Global ID (GID) and a set of pseudonyms (PID)\n",
    "- Nodes exchange GID and GID's public key prior to unicast communication\n",
    "- Certificates certified by the CA bind the public key to the GID\n",
    "- PID can change during communication\n",
    "- PID can be used in communication but cannot disclose persons identity\n",
    "- PID is associated with a public/private key pairs through assymetric cryptography\n",
    "- Node can change  its PID, signature and certificate to prevent identity and location tracking\n",
    "- A security framework is required to assure (see the VSC project):\n",
    "    - Key distribution and revocation procedures \n",
    "    - Security services (authentication, authorization, integrity, non-repudiation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adversary model\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversary can potentially: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Link the disclosed data to the user's identity and invade it's privacy:\n",
    "    - in the case of  the electronic license plate, find the personal data of the driver\n",
    "- _Hack_ into an OBU, reads the communication logs\n",
    "- Eavesdrop the the wireless communication\n",
    "- Misuse the location service to track nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implication of pseudonymity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross-layer addressing and information exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "  Assuming a node uses mutliple addresses simultaneouly:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Changing a pseudonym only at one layer implies the risk that an adversary links two pseudonyms by unchanged address at another protocol layer\n",
    "    -  Pseudonymity requires changing all addresses accross a node's protocol stack at the same time\n",
    "  - To provide non-repudiation, pseudonym must be chosen from a preloaded set:\n",
    "    - best scheme is the one that allows all addresses to be from one single pseudonym (_TODO_ !)\n",
    "  - Some protocols (ex. link state information), not conceive to support PID change,  will fail when the addresses changes \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resolution service for pseudonym:\n",
    " \n",
    " Node peer identification is required for establishing communication session:\n",
    " \n",
    "  - If the addresses changed without notification, peers involved in the communication cannot identify each other\n",
    "  - The system must offer a service that resolves the true identifier to the current Pseudonym (GID to PID)\n",
    "  - The resolution must be disclosed only to trusted nodes and communicating peers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Effect on routing\n",
    "\n",
    " VANET node moves typically at high speeds, it happens freqently that nodes have outdated frowarding entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - PID change cannot be distinguished from the case that a new neighbor leaves its transmission range:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - node would have an outdated entry for forwarding or unicast packets. Implies:\n",
    "        \n",
    "       - wrong forwarding decission and packet loss\n",
    "            \n",
    "   - PID change aggravates the problem of stale entries in location tables, pseudpnymity can significantly degrade system performance by increasing unicast packet loss\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Forwarding broadcast packets using simple broadcast strategies (naive flooding) is not impaired:\n",
    "     \n",
    "       - because it is based on broadcast addresses on link and network layer\n",
    "       \n",
    "   - Enhanced broacasting algorithms based on knownledge of neighbors are impacted by PID change since a node with a new PID is regarded as a new node and: \n",
    "      \n",
    "      - unecessary packet forwarding and redundant packet transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interruption of established communication sessions\n",

    " - Session continuity achieved by:\n",
    "     - session re-establishment\n",
