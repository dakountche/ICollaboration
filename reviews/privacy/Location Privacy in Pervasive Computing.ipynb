    "## The problem studied\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pervasive computing make possible:\n",
    "  - access to reliable and timely information about the exact location of others\n",
    "  - adversaries can have access to the location history (seconds, submeters accuracy)\n",
    "  - location tracking systems generates enourmous amount of potentially sensitive information\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy is requirement of the law:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 1361:England:Justice of the Peace act (Arrest of eavesdroppers and stalkers)\n",
    "  - 1890:USA:Fourth Amendment to the Constitution (Rigth to be left alone)\n",
    "  - 1948:UN:Universal declaration of Human Rigths (Privacy at home,with family and in correspondance)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Definition of privacy by the [Global Internet Liberty](http://gilc.org/privacy/) Campain as :\n",
    "   - information privacy, bodily privacy, privacy of communications and territorial privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Locaiton privacy:\n",
    "   - is the ability to prevent other parties from learning one's current or past location\n",
    "   - form of information privacy\n",
    "   - is also the ability to be in control :\n",
    "      - let some application access to the position and others not\n",
    "   - there conflicts with other goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some applications can be accessed: \n",
    " - completly anonymously\n",
    " - require the true identity\n",
    " - require an identity (even pseudonymous) \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, how to develop techniques that let users benefit from location-based applications while at the same time retaining their location privacy ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Will the application still work when the user changes under its feet ? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming using  anonymization proxies will not break existing application, how this approach improves location privacy ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a long-term pseudonym for each user does not provide much privacy, even if user gives out different pseudonyms to different application to avoid collunison:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - certains regions in spaces acts as homes (are strongly associated with certain identities)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - applications can try to follow the footsteps of a pseudonym by:\n",
    "         1. Where does any given pseudonym spent most of its time ?\n",
    "         2. Who spend more time than anyone else at a given position ? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threat model \n",
    "\n",
    " - User cannot always refuse to be tracked\n",
    " - User have no control on the application and cannot trust application providers\n",
    " - User can trust positioning systems where the positioning is local (for other positioning systems it depends)\n",
    " - Availability of nationwide network of face-recognition (like CCTV cameras)\n",
    " \n",
    "### Adversary model \n",
    "  - Application providers migth collude against the user to discobver the information the user aim to hide\n",
    "  - All application as one global hostile observer\n",
    "  - The system spatial and temporal resolution can be high\n",

    "## The solution proposed \n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy-protection framework based on frequently changing pseudonyms so users avoid being identified by the locations they visit by:\n",
    " - the concept of mix zones maps location privacy to anonymous communications\n",
    " - hide the true identity from the application receiving the location\n",
    " - compartmentalization by letting location services register for location callbacks only at the same site where the service is provided\n",
    " \n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "1. A middleware event model through which entities entering or exiting a predefined region of space generates events. Applications register their interrest in a particular set of locations and locatables and receive callbacks when the corresponding events occurred \n",
    "2. The middleware is trusted and may help users to hide their identity\n",
    "3. Users registers interest in particular application with the middleware\n",
    "4. Application receives event callbacks from the middleware when user enter, moves or exits the application-defined area\n",
    "5. Each update period, the middleware determines wheter any event have occured and issues callbacks  to application when appropriate\n",
    "6. Availability of an  anonimyzation proxy for all communications between users and application \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- David Chaum proposes for anonymous communication:\n",
    "   - Mix network\n",
    "   - Dining cryptographers algorithm\n",
    "   - Anonymity sets\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Mix network: a store-and-forward network that offers anonymous communication facilities:\n",
    "     - an observer can not trace a message from its source to its destination without the collusion of the mix nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mix node: \n",
    "    - collects $n$ equal-length packets as input and reorders them by some metric before forwarding them, thus providing unlinkability between incoming and outgoing messages\n",
    "    - can encrypt the messages\n",
    "    - the anonymity set is the number of distinct senders in the batch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mix zones \n",
    "\n",
    "- A mix zone is :  \n",
    "  - for a group of user a connected spatial region of maximum size in which none of these users has registered any application callback. For a given group of users there migth be several distinct mix zone\n",
    "  - analogous to mix node\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- An application zone is the area where a user has a registered a callback for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The middleware can define the mix zone apriori or calculate them separatly for each group of users as the spatial areas currently not in an application zone \n",
    "\n",
    "- Application do not receive any information when user are in the mix zone (identities are mixed)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming users change to a new and unsuded pseudonym whenever they enter a mix zone, applications that see a user emerging from the mix zone cannot distinguish that  a user from any other who was in the mix zone at the same time and cannot link people going into the mix zone with those coming out of it\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a mix zone has a diameter $(D)$ much larger than the distance $(d(u,m))$ the user can cover during one location update period, it migth not mix users adequatly. For example the figutre below :\n",
    "\n",
    "![mix zone](mixzone.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anonymity sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each mix zone that user $u$ visits during time period $t$, the anonimity set is the group of people visiting the mix zone during the same time period\n",
    "- User can set a threshold on the anonymity set size\n",
    "- this value can be approach by a probability function (time dependant) :\n",
    "     - Can estimane the average value \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Futher reasearch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing application use of pseudonyms\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a set of preferences were accessed by several different pseudonyms, the application would easily guess that these pseudonyms map the same user\n",
    "- The user state for each pseudonym looks, to the application, different from that of any other pseudonym\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two difficulties :\n",
    "   1. The state for a given user (common to all that user's pseudonym) must be stored elsewhere and then supplied to the application in an anonymized fashion\n",
    "   2. The application must not be able to determine that two sets of preference map to the same user, so a small random variation needs to be added:\n",
    "      - if this variation is insignificant an observer can recongzise it\n",
    "      - if significant, it could affect the semantics and therefore the functionanlity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reacting to insignificant anonymity\n",
    "\n",
    "- How a user should react to a warning that the measured anonymity is failling below a certain threshold ? :\n",
    "    - Stop divulging location information\n",
    "    - Reduce the the size or number of the applications in which a user has registerd\n",
    "- \"Reconciling privacy with application functionality is still, in general, an open problem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving the models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define anonymity sets and entropy measurements from the perspective of what a hostile observer can see and deduce, instead of counting the user in the mix zone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dummy users\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dummy users as dummy messages but :\n",
    "    - can be a waste of ressources\n",
    "    - difficult to construct\n",
    "\n",
    "### Granularity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The effectiveness of mixing depends not only on the user population and on the mix zone's geometry, but also on the sensing system's update rate and spatial resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try the solution on a wider scale (city, country)\n",
