    "\n",
    "- A station will only know it's next MAC address, but will not be able to determine who will use its original MAC \n",
    "\n",
    "The shuffle procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A station broadcasts a Shuffle Request Message with a cutoff time specification\n",
    "2. Receiving nodes will decide whether to participate to the shuffle or not. Decision factors can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ongoing connections\n",
    "    - time of the last shuffle\n",
    "    - more criterias can be define\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. If a node joins the shuffle, it sends a Participation Shuffle Message (PSM) to the initiator with its own USN and encrypts its current MAC address by its Encryption Key (generated during the first DMAS server contact). This message is broadcasted using a faked source MAC address.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The initiator collects the USNs and their corresponding encrypted MAC address until the cutoff time. Then, sends a SCD (Shuffled Collection Done) message containing this collection to the DMAS\n",

    "5. Upon receiving the SCD message, the DMAS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - decrypts all the encrypted MAC addresses using the shared EKs with the stations. The USN is the index to locate the keys at DMAS (have a database holding all the information needed by the process)\n",
    "  - permutates all the USNs that participate to the shuffle\n",
    "  - generates update notifications for all the the participating nodes based on the permuation result\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DMAS broadcasts a Shuffle Instruction Message (SIS) composed of a set of exchanged pairs $(USN,Encrypt(MAC_{tochange}))$. \n",
    "The USN in the exchange pair is still in plaintext and EK encrypts the MAC address to the node specified by the USN. \n",
    "Once the node receives the the broadcast, it will get the correct pair, decrypt the second element in the pair and changes its current MAC adddress after a variable silent period. Only the holder of the key can decrypt the message. \n",
    "An adversary cannot link the old Mac adddress with the new one, even if the adversary particiapte to the shuffle.\n",
